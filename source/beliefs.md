# What We Believe

Grace Lutheran Church is a small 15-member congregation of the [Wisconsin
Evangelical Lutheran Synod](http://www.wels.net). Our focus is spreading the
inerrant word of God to Christ's children throughout the Minot area.

We meet for service on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Sundays of the month at 2 p.m. in
the fellowship hall of [Immanuel Baptist Church]({{site.url}}/location).

### What is the Bible?

*   The inspired and inerrant Word of God (John 10:35, II Peter 1:21)
*   The only rule and guide for faith and life (II Timothy 3:16)
*   The Bible consists of two main teachings: Law and Gospel
*   The Law reveals our sin to us and shows us our need for salvation (Romans 3:23)
*   The Gospel tells us that Jesus has forgiven our sins and given us life everlasting in his death and resurrection (II Timothy 2:8)

  
### Who is God?

*   The only true God has revealed himself to us in the Bible (Isaiah 45:5)
*   Three distinct persons- Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19)
*   Yet one God (Deuteronomy 6:4)
*   Eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful and present everywhere (Revelation 22:13, John 21:17, Genesis 17:1, Jeremiah 23:24)
*   Spirit- he isn’t confined to a particular place or time (John 4:24)
*   Just yet forgiving (Exodus 34:6,7)

  
### Sin

*   God demands perfect holiness from all people (Leviticus 19:2)
*   All people were born into sin (Psalm 51:5)
*   No one has the ability to do good and keep God’s law. (Romans 3:9-18, Romans 3:23)

  
### Who is Jesus?

*   The only Son of God (Romans 1:4)
*   Fully God (I John 5:20)
*   Fully Human (Hebrews 4:15)
*   The world’s Savior from sin (John 3:16)

  
### Salvation from Sin and Death

*   God offers mankind salvation from sin and death as a free gift of his grace (Ephesians 2:8,9)
*   This salvation was won for us by the perfect life, innocent death and resurrection of God’s only Son, Jesus. (Galatians 4:4,5, II Corinthians 5:21)
*   On the cross, Jesus paid for the sins of all people (I John 2:2)
*   This salvation becomes ours through faith in Jesus, not by our own works or merit (Romans 3:28, Romans 4:5)

  
### Faith

*   The Holy Spirit alone creates faith in people’s hearts. (I Corinthians 12:3)
*   Saving faith in Jesus is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8,9)
*   The Holy Spirit works through God’s Word, specifically the Gospel, to create faith (Romans 10:17)

  
### Baptism

*   The Holy Spirit works through Baptism to cleanse us from sin (Acts 2:38) and give us new life (Titus 3:5).
*   Baptism is not just a symbol, but a means by which God the Holy Spirit brings to us the salvation won for us by Jesus’ death and     resurrection (I Peter 3:21)

  
### Lord’s Supper (Holy Communion)

*   The Lord’s Supper was instituted by Jesus for Christians to partake in (Matthew 26:26-28)
*   Jesus true body and blood are present with (not symbolizing or replacing) the bread and wine. (I Corinthians 10:16, Matthew 26:26-28)
*   Believers receive forgiveness in the Lord’s Supper (Matthew 26:26-28)
*   The Lord’s Supper is an expression of fellowship and unity between believers united in faith and doctrine (I Corinthians 10:17)

  
### Our Response to Salvation

*   Good works flow from saving faith in Jesus (James 2:17) and are the result of saving faith, not the cause of it (John 15:5)
*   Without saving faith in Jesus, one cannot produce good works (Hebrews 11:6)
*   A believer is motivated to do good works because of God’s mercy (Romans 12:1)
*   God’s Word alone can tell us what is and is not pleasing to God
